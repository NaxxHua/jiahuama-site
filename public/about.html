<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Born and raised in Xinjiang, China, I started my journey in the US since 2014,
  fueled by an initial interest in comparative literature. However, recognizing
  the vast potential and impact of technology, I redirected my pursuits towards
  programming. With a robust educational foundation from Penn State University,
  I have leveraged my degrees in Informatics (Master's with a focus on
  Human-Computer Interaction) and Applied Data Sciences (Bachelor) to further
  pursuit my dreams. Since February 2022, I've been a proud member of Visa Inc.,
  where I've played an important role in shaping the Visa Product Design
  System's Flutter component library.

  My entrepreneurial spirit is also vividly reflected in my projects. As a
  Co-founder and Front-end Lead at PsySpace, I've spearheaded initiatives that
  use technology as an enabler for mental health support, with a particular
  emphasis on the challenges faced by young adults. Furthermore, my academic
  research at Penn State's User Agency Lab has led to notable contributions,
  including co-authoring a paper for CSCW 2020 and devising applications that
  bring a tangible difference to the gig economy.

  Outside of my professional tech projects, my passion for creativity finds a
  home in the world of gaming. I run a game studio that's currently immersed in
  developing a captivating 2D platformer game. Additionally, my tenure as Vice
  President and multiple roles at the Chinese Theater and Movie Society at Penn
  State allowed me to explore and express various facets of the performing arts.

<p>
  Across all my efforts, I continuously strive for excellence, innovation, and a
  touch of empathy—ensuring that technology not only works for people but also
  resonates with their aspirations and needs. 测试
