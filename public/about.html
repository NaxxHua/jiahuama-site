      <p>
        Born and raised in Xinjiang, China, I started my journey in the US in
        2014. Initially interested in comparative literature, I redirected my
        pursuits towards programming. With degrees in Informatics (Master's with
        a focus on Human-Computer Interaction) and Applied Data Sciences
        (Bachelor's) from Penn State University, I have been contributing to
        Visa Inc. since February 2022.

        As a Co-founder and Front-end Lead at PsySpace, I have led projects
        using technology for mental health support. My academic research at Penn
        State has led to notable contributions, including co-authoring a paper
        for CSCW 2020.
      </p>

        Outside of work, I run a game studio and have held various roles in the
        Chinese Theater and Movie Society at Penn State.
