        <p>
          Born and raised in Xinjiang, China, I started my journey in the US in 2014. Initially interested in comparative literature, I redirected my pursuits towards programming. With degrees in Informatics (Master's with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction) and Applied Data Sciences (Bachelor's) from Penn State University, I have been contributing to Visa Inc. since February 2022.

          As a Co-founder and Front-end Lead at PsySpace, I have led projects using technology for mental health support. My academic research at Penn State has led to notable contributions, including co-authoring a paper for CSCW 2020.

          Outside of work, I run a game studio and have held various roles in the Chinese Theater and Movie Society at Penn State.
